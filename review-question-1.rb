# How would you get the url for Bulbasaur's ability?
puts pokemon.find {|pokemon| pokemon[:name] == "bulbasaur"}[:abilities][0][:ability][:url]

# How would you return the first pokemon with base experience over 40?
puts pokemon.find {|pokemon| pokemon[:base_experience] > 40}

# How would you return ALL OF THE pokemon with base experience over 40? (Gotta catch em all)
puts pokemon.find_all {|pokemon| pokemon[:base_experience] > 40}

# How would you return an array of all of the pokemon's names?
puts pokemon.map {|pokemon| pokemon[:name]}

# How would you determine whether or not the pokemon array contained any pokemon with a weight greater than 60?
#  whatever method you use should return true if there are any such pokemon, false if not.
puts pokemon.any? {|pokemon| pokemon[:weight] > 60}


#puts all_pokemon(pokemon)
